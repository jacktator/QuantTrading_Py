# Maths for Forex Margin Trading

Forex Trading usually is done with leverage, here're examples comparing leverage. 

## Without Leverage: 

Equity required to trade a standard lot of AUDUSD would be **AUD$100,000** converted to USD.

Assuming **1 pip rise** in price, aka 0.01%, aka 0.0001 change in price, will result calculate as $100,000 * 0.01% profit. **Profit = AUD$10 - SWAPs**.

Or simply **1 pip = $10 of the base currency**

Therefore, Return is AUD$10 / AUD$100,000 = **0.01%** (Or simply, 1 pip). 

**Return Fomula without Leverage** is therefore:

> Return = 1 pip * 1 = 0.01% = 0.0001 (p_change * 1)

The 1 means 1:1 Leverage, or no leverage.

## With Leverage:

Let's assume the following:

Leverage: 400

Equity required to trade a standard lot of AUDUSD would be AUD$100,000 / 400, or **AUD$250** converted to USD.

Assuming **1 pip rise** in price, aka 0.01%, aka 0.0001 change in price, will result calculate as $100,000 * 0.01% profit. **Profit = AUD$10 - SWAPs**.

Or simply **1 pip = $10 of the base currency**

Therefore, **Return Fomula with Leverage** is AUD$10 / AUD$250 = **4%** (or simply, 400 pip).

**Return Fomula without Leverage** is therefore:

> Return = 1 pip * 400 = 4% = 0.04 (p_change * 400)

The 400 means 1:400 Leverage.
